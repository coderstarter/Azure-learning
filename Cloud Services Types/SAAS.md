### What is SaaS?

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** is a cloud computing model where software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual computers or servers, users can access the software through a web browser. The service provider hosts the software and handles maintenance, security, and updates, allowing users to focus on their core tasks without worrying about managing the software infrastructure.

### Key Features of SaaS:

1. **Accessibility**: Access applications from any device with an internet connection.
2. **Subscription-Based**: Typically offered on a subscription basis, often monthly or annually.
3. **Scalability**: Easily scale usage based on user needs.
4. **Automatic Updates**: The provider handles software updates and maintenance.
5. **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the need for upfront hardware and software investments.
