Sure, here is a comprehensive summary of the shared responsibility model, ensuring all information is included:

## Shared Responsibility Model in Cloud Computing

### Traditional Corporate Datacenter Responsibilities
In a traditional corporate datacenter:
- **Physical Security and Maintenance**: The company handles maintaining physical space, security, and server replacements.
- **IT Department Tasks**: Responsible for maintaining all infrastructure and software, ensuring systems are patched and on the correct version.

### Shared Responsibility Model
In cloud computing, responsibilities are divided between the cloud provider and the consumer.

#### Cloud Provider Responsibilities
- **Physical Security**: Protecting the physical datacenter.
- **Power and Cooling**: Ensuring proper power supply and cooling systems.
- **Network Connectivity**: Maintaining network infrastructure.

#### Consumer Responsibilities
- **Data and Information**: Ensuring data stored in the cloud is secure and protected.
- **Access Security**: Managing who has access to the data and systems.

#### Situational Responsibilities
- **Cloud SQL Database**: 
  - **Provider**: Maintaining the actual database infrastructure.
  - **Consumer**: Managing the data that gets ingested into the database.
- **Virtual Machine with SQL**:
  - **Consumer**: Responsible for database patches, updates, and maintaining the data and information stored in the database.

### Cloud Service Types and Responsibilities
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
  - **Provider**: Basic responsibilities like physical security, power, and connectivity.
  - **Consumer**: Operating systems, applications, data, and access security.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
  - **Middle Ground**: Both provider and consumer share responsibilities.
  - **Provider**: Infrastructure and runtime environment.
  - **Consumer**: Applications, data, and access security.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
  - **Provider**: Most responsibilities, including applications, infrastructure, and security.
  - **Consumer**: Data and access security.

### Key Consumer Responsibilities
- **Data Security**: Protecting and managing data stored in the cloud.
- **Device Management**: Ensuring secure connections from devices like computers and cell phones.
- **Identity and Access Management**: Controlling accounts and identities of users, services, and devices within the organization.

### Key Cloud Provider Responsibilities
- **Datacenter Security**: Safeguarding the physical datacenter.
- **Network Infrastructure**: Maintaining physical network components.
- **Physical Host Maintenance**: Ensuring the security and functionality of physical hosts.

### Determining Responsibility by Service Model
- **Operating Systems**: Responsibility can vary based on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
- **Network Controls**: Shared between provider and consumer, depending on the service model.
- **Applications**: Managed by the provider in SaaS, by the consumer in IaaS, and shared in PaaS.
- **Identity and Infrastructure**: Divided based on the service type, with more responsibility on the consumer in IaaS.

### Summary
- With an on-premises datacenter, the company is responsible for everything.
- In cloud computing, responsibilities shift to a shared model:
  - **Always Consumer's Responsibility**: Information and data stored in the cloud, devices that connect to the cloud, and accounts and identities within the organization.
  - **Always Provider's Responsibility**: Physical datacenter, physical network, and physical hosts.
  - **Shared Responsibility**: Operating systems, network controls, and applications, depending on the cloud service type (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

The shared responsibility model helps clarify the division of tasks between the cloud provider and the consumer, depending on the cloud service used, ensuring both parties know their specific responsibilities to maintain security and functionality in cloud computing.
